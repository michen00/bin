HELP=$(
  cat << EOF
Usage: $(basename "$0") [-y] [TARGET_BRANCH]
Usage Example: $(basename "$0") -y my-branch

Arguments:
  TARGET_BRANCH  The branch to compare against for merged branches. Defaults to 'main'.

Options:
  -h, --help   Show this help message and exit.
  -y           Automatically confirm deletion of merged and stale branches.

Description:
  This script performs the following actions:
  1. Fetches the latest remote information and prunes deleted branches.
  2. Identifies local branches that are fully merged into the TARGET_BRANCH.
  3. Prompts the user (or automatically confirms with -y) to delete these merged branches.
  4. Identifies local branches that no longer have a remote.
  5. Prompts the user (or automatically confirms with -y) to delete these stale branches.
