Usage: $SCRIPT_NAME [OPTIONS] <reference_branch>

Merges the latest changes from a reference branch into the current branch.

Arguments:
  <reference_branch>  The branch to merge into the current branch.

Options:
  -h, --help          Show this help message and exit.

This script performs the following steps:
  1. Ensures you are inside a Git repository.
  2. Pulls the latest changes for the current branch.
  3. Fetches updates for the reference branch.
  4. Merges the reference branch into the current branch.

Examples:
  $SCRIPT_NAME main
  $SCRIPT_NAME feature-branch
